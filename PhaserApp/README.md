# Phaser App
- Install node and npm
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Launch the app: `node server.js"
if you want to put the server ip adress just run "npm start serverIpAdress" where serverIpAdress is the ipAdress of the machine running the server
(! it must be in the same network than the one you use to run phaser. NB the two machines can be the same)
